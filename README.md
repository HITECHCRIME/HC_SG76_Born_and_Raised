## Lyrics

```

death of trust
lost it in a ditch
buried deep
in the skies
planned to be 
mighty g aye
constructs rise
in my mind 
born and dead
fucking lies
burn my head
liquid lead
poured (it) into
intrinsic
basic instincts
with this shit ye

fight or flight
tell me why
you ain't right
in your mind ya
bless the mars
raging farce will find ya

divination from the spots is aight
like a telescope
in your nose
fucking hoes
stardust in your nose (?)
is blight
get the smoke
it's its ghosts and whatnot
that forever
will be gone
when i'm done aye

x

get the smoke
its its ghosts and whatnot
that forever
will be gone
when i'm done aye

x

it's its ghosts and whatnot
that forever
will be gone
when i'm done aye


SECOND VERSE

death of trust
lost it in a ditch
buried deep
in the skies
planned to be 
mighty g aye
constructs rise
in my mind 
born and dead
fucking lies
burn my head
liquid lead
poured into
intrinsic
basic instincts
with this shit ye

fight or flight
tell me why
you ain't right
in your mind ya

bless the mars
raging farce will find ya
[definition comes with shots at night]
like a telescope (crowbar)
in your [eyes]
[running close]
stardust in your [eyes] (?)
is [pride]
get the smoke
it's its ghosts and whatnot
that (i lost) forever (- no)
[will to fight]
[but i tried aye]


-
dope
pulled the tab
gave it far 
too much faith

better spread

scope
whatever life throws (at me)
dosed
even if it's gold

```
